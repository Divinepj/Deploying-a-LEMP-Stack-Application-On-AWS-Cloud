A LEMP Stack is a solution stack that is being used in deploying web applications. It stands for Linux, Nginx, MySql and php,perl or python.

Linux: this is an operating system which serves as the backbone of the LAMP Stack, and it is actively used in deploying other components.

Nginx: NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

MySQL: use for creating and maintaining dynamic databases. It supports SQL and relational tables and provides a DBMS(Database Management System).

PHP,PERL or PYTHON: this represents programming languages which effectively combines all the elements of the LAMP stack and is used to make web applications execute.
